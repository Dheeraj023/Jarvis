# Bulding Jarvis (AGI) - Tauri + React
An AI Assistant which will have agentic capabilities, should be able to respond verbally and do some tasks on the screen.
1. It should be able to convert my speach into actions
2. It should be able to have the ability see what I see on the screen
3. Also it should be able to listen and understand what I say and should be able to act accordingly based on the context of what I've telling it to do.

## To Create a Assistant like that I've decided to create a Desktop Application :-
1. To Build an App I've chosen Tauri Framework With ReactJS with vite and installed all the dependancies
    + NPM and Rust should be installed a prerequisite 
    + Create a Tauri Project `npm create tauri@latest` > ReactJS (for this case)
    + Open the project and install all the dependencies using `npm install` 
    + Run the project using `npm run tauri dev`
